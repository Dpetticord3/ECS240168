# Ecosphere:  ECS24-0168 - Planted species influences soil phosphorus losses in a historically fertilized pasture system: a mesocosm study
#This repository contains a master dataframe including all of the final processed data from the Archbold Biological Station FDACS phosphorus shadehouse project, 
carried out at Buck Island Ranch in 2020. 

#It also includes a 'Leachatewithcontrol.csv' used in analysis relating the filled pots to the empty ones. 

All of the figures present in the manuscript can be reproduced using the data. I included a 'finalMSFigures.R' file that includes minimally annotated code for each of the figures, including tests for normality and #the necessary ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Tukey's, and Dunn's tests used within the manuscript. Please reach out if there are any problems or if you have further questions. The authors contact information is:
